Introduction -:
In our Angular User Registration Form project, we've successfully crafted an intuitive and user-friendly registration experience. This vital component is designed to cater to user onboarding, ensuring the collection of essential personal information. By harnessing the power of Angular, we've established a robust foundation for form handling and validation, promoting data accuracy and enhancing the overall user experience.

Key Features -:
Our User Registration Form showcases a range of powerful features. We've developed a dedicated Angular component named registration-form, offering a clear separation of concerns. The HTML template is thoughtfully designed, delivering an aesthetically pleasing interface for users. Robust form handling mechanisms and comprehensive validation ensure data integrity, with real-time feedback for users. Security is paramount, and we've enforced password matching for additional protection. Submissions are logged to the console, offering transparency in the registration process, and we've incorporated a custom password validator to bolster password strength.
